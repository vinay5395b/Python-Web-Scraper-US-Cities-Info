# Python-Web-Scraper-US-Cities-Info-
A Python web scrper to extract data about the top cities in US from Wikipedia and individual sites of the cities.

The scraper is written in Python using BeautifulSoup and Pandas libraries. 
The code can be directly run on any Python IDE. 
The fetched data is stored in a file called Dataset.csv after the cleaning tasks are done.
The information is limited to only 80-90 cities as only the cities with full information as provided by the wikipedia pages were considered. 
The 'Official Website' attribute for all the cities could not be fetched as some of them did not have unique tags to differentiate them with other fields.
